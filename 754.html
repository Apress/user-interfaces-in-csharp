Ctrl key as indicated in the text.</p>

Figure 3-8. It should refer to Figure 3-9 instead.</p>

<p>p. 154&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final two sentences of the last paragraph claim

can use access other Windows in your application. This is not correct, although
you could show forms on multiple different threads to achieve this result.</p>

Hashtable (because keys are not used in this collection).</p>

<p>p. 164&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In second paragraph. &quot;... which you must be set
to System ...&quot; should be &quot;... which you must set to System ...&quot;</p>
